# Midterms
Story Map
Project Outline
For this midterm project, I will create a story map application for crimes in Philadelphia where the user will be able to move forward and backwards through the slides by clicking on next and previous buttons.

# Requirements
The story map will have at least five slides (extra interactivity can reduce this requirement)
The story map should have next and previous buttons
On the first slide of my story map, the previous button will be hidden
On the last slide of my story map, the next button will be hidden
The application would be structured in a way where clicking on the next and previous buttons will replace the data on the map and the text in the sidebar with the next or previous content (in other words, I am not building five different maps with different text and dataâ€” I am building one map in which the content changes based on user input)
At least one slide will change the zoom level or center of the map; see fitBounds, setView, setZoom, and related functions

Getting Started
The midterm should be a new repository that you create on your personal github account. Create a new repository on GitHub.com and then clone it to your local machine using GitHub Desktop.

# Prototype
To see a visual representation of how the story map should work, take a look at this clickable prototype that uses Marvel (similar to Figma). Please note that this prototype is only meant to represent the functionality of the story map. Feel free to use your own layout, color, and other styles, as long as the functionality is the same. Your story map will use a different dataset.
